# surfs_up
Analyzing weather data in jupyter botebook to make a weather app

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the temperature statistics for the month of June and the month of December in Oahu. Using this data we will see if a surf shop will be able to operate year round. We run two separate queries and store the temperature in a list, which is then stored into a DataFrame. We can use this newly created DataFrame to print out a summary of our statistics.

## Results
* June we had a total count of 1700, which a mean of 74.9 degrees F, a min of 64.0 degrees F, and a maximum of 85.0 degrees F.
* In December we had a total count of 1517, with a mean of 71.0 degrees F, min of 56.0 degrees F, and a maximum of 83.0 degrees F.
* The standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December, with a difference of 0.5 between the two seasons.

## Summary
From our data we can conclude that the average temperatures between June and December are 3.9 degrees F difference. The maximum temperatures of each month for June and December are 85.0 degrees F and 83.0 degrees F, respectively. However, the minimun temperature in June is 64.0 degrees F and the minimun temperature in December is 56.0 degrees F. This means there will be some days where it might not be optimal surfing temperatures. And June having a standard deviation of 3.25 and December having a standard deviation of 3.75 means the temperatures is relatively optimal for surfind year round. It would be viable to surf in Oahu year round.
